    <h3>Before my arrival.</h2>

    <p class="Content">
      Before actually moving to Leeds I had visited it over the holidays and immediately fell under its charm.
      The arcades, the university... The city was such a clean and refreshing break from what I'd been used to before
      that I was very excited at the prospect of living there for the next 4 years of my life.

    <h3>Grayson heights, my first accomodation.</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      Moving into Grayson Heights was quite intimidating. If you go on the
      <a href="https://accommodation.leeds.ac.uk/residence/37/grayson-heights">University Of Leeds accomodation website</a>,
      you can see it for yourself. To be frank, I hated my time at Grayson Heights. My fresher's week hadn't gone
      really well at all, my flatmates weren't really friendly and the distance from Univserity combined to make me feel isolated and
      unhappy. My first month at Leeds was very unpleasant. Luckily by early October, I was finally able to apply for a different
      accomodation.

    <h3>My succesful move to The Tannery.</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      I had already been in contact with my personal tutor and had already queried the Accomodation office about procedures and
      applications for moving. My case was streamlined through and I was assigned a new home: The Tannery. My uncle came up to help
      me move in his little grey car. Here are some pictures of the move:

           indexCount = slides.length;
        }
        for (var count = 0; count < slides.length; count++) {
          slides[count].style.display = "none";
        }
        slides[indexCount-1].style.display = "block";

    <p class="Content">
      As you can probably tell by my stupid grin, I was very happy to be away. Here's an anecdote. A few days before actually moving,
       I met a person called Matt in the School of Computing Long Room. We started chatting and the topic of accomodation came up,
      as is customary in the first weeks of Uni. Matt told me one of his flatmates had just left and that a spare room had become
      available. He then told me he lived in the Tannery in flat 315A which by sheer coincidence was where I was moving to!
      I'm now very happy with my current situation, having made plenty of friends from many different backgrounds.
