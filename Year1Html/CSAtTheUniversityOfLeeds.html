    <h3>Ack, Computers!</h3>

    <p>
      Before coming to the University of Leeds, the realm of computer science had always seemed to me like an exotic universe,
      understood only by a small cabal of sociopathic geeks. Yes it was quite stereotypical and based entirely on my ignorance
      of the subject, but it nevertheless governed my overall approach to the subject. The closest I had ever come to
      programming was through the programmable calculators I had to get for high school, using basics such as loops and conditions.

    <h3>The dive into the deep blue.</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      As stated before, I truly love video games. They have played an integral part in my childhood, creating fond memories whether they
      be personal or with friends. They greatly motivated me in wanting to learn how these games were made. What was the magic behind the
      stories, the characters, the worlds, that brought them all to life? Starting computer science essentially from scratch seemed
      very difficult at first. Although I felt proud of my first little programs, learning the syntax of languages and grinding through
      the difficult task of actually understanding how the elements of my code worked was quite challenging. Furthermore, I was introduced to
      other aspects of the subject that I hadn't even seriously considered or even thought about, such as its ethical aspect, which was very
      interesting to think about.

      Despite this vast intake and initial uphill struggle, the subject becomes much more linear and patterns begin to emerge. The
      most difficult, I think, is getting started; after a bit of practice and contact, it is a much more enjoyable and stimulating subject.
