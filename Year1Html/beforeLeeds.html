    <h3>My studies before Leeds.</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      Before arriving at leeds, I had just graduated from high school with a Scientific Baccalaureat. This is quite different to the
      A level approach found in the UK. Instead of choosing three subjects and studying them for 3 years, I had to cover a vast
      repertoire ranging from french literature to quantum mechanics. Additionally, I had chosen to do a Baccalaureat with an
      "international option" (OIB). Consequently, I was given an extra three subjects, namely History, Geography and English
      Literature; all taught in English. With such a degree, I was able to pursue an education that could address my wide range
      of interests.
    </p>

    <p class="Content">
      I really enjoyed my High School years, and I was able to make some great friends as well as get excellet marks on my final
      exams.

    <p class="Content">
      I applied for schools in the UK as well as in France, but for totally different subjects. My first choice in the UK
      was Computer Science with High performance Graphics and Games engineering at Leeds and my first choice in France was History
      and Economics at the Sorbonne. Having recieved an offer from both, I had to decide on which path I wanted to go.
    </p>

    <p class="Content">
      Decision time was fast approaching and my mind was still not set. Eventually my love for Video Games, the innumerable
      good times I had playing them and the opportunity to be a part of actually making them, tipped the balance in favour
      of the University of Leeds.
