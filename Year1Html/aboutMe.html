    <h3>Who am I?</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      You might have stumbled upon this website inadvertidly and may not know who I am. This is problematic as this website
      is entirely dedicated to my very self. Worry not as I am  about to reveal my identity: My name is Thomas, or Tommy as
      I prefer to be nicknamed, Moreno-Cooper. The hyphen is very important. Born on the 30<sup>th</sup> of april 1999, I am the eldest son of a French
      engineer and a british English teacher. By the way, I'm fluent in French and Enlish.
    </p>

    <h3>Where do I come from?</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      As you may have already seen on the Home page, I come from the South of France, near Marseille in fact. I've spent a total of 18 years in the south.
      My education has taken me around the Cote Bleue, from Ensues-la-Redonne to Sausset-Les-Pins, and into Provence, culminating in Aix-en-Povence.

    <h3>What are my interests?</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      I have always had, and taken great pride in, my wide ranging interests. Whether it be music, literature, sciences, politics, history... You
      name it, I probably know about it. But one of the things that has continually grabbed my attention since the fist time I encountered it is Video Games.
      Even to this day I cannot pin point why they enthrall me so much, but I can guarantee that playing video games is the only things in which I will
      for sure be able to sink hours of my time into.
    </p>

    <h3>Some things I like.</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      I like a lot of things: Ricky Gervais, Tchaikovsky, going out to the pub, writing progams, South Park, Star Wars<sup>tm</sup>... But one of the things I
      really like to do at the moment is to loose myself on that great website YouTube, listening to some music. Holst's The Planets suite is so evocative to
      me that it's my favorite piece of music, here is Jupiter the Bringer of Jollity.
