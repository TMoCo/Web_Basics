    <h3>The future.</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      Well, here we are, the future. To be entirely honest, it isn't something I tend to focus on too much. I think that setting one's mind
      to something too early may deprive one of possibly better opportunities. Nevertheless, I would like to think that I
      may at some point work for a video game company one day. After all, it is one of the main reasons behind me taking a Computer
      Science degree.

      One thing that I know I must do is visit some other countries. The farthest I have ever been from home was Denmark to visit
      one of my uncles. Hopefully I may one day be able to visit North and South America.

    <h3>But before that...</h3>

    <p class="Content">
      I don't want to get ahead of myself so I'll think about the coming easter holidays. I'll be heading back down south to see
      my friends and family, I wasn't able to go down over the christmas break so I have been very much looking forward to it.
    </p>

    <p class="Content">
      But most importantly, I'm going to see my little minx of a kitten Effie Gray, and give her a long awaited cuddle.
